# Number & String Puzzles

Based on prompts from [this](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

Generic puzzles will be in **number-puzzles.py** or **string-puzzles.py**. A command line interface to run all tools for these will be accessible in **interface.py**.

Any more complex tasks will have their own files.
